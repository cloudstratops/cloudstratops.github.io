What is this site about?

If you happen to be a technology decision maker ( blanket term for any managerial or leadership position) and find cloud quite intimidating then this website is for you. 

I hope below chart makes it clear.



There would be more focus on AWS for two reasons
1) It is cloud that i know
2) Similar concepts should apply in most cases on other clouds

I intend to cover some of the keep decisions that would be faced by any IT Executive as they chart their journey to the cloud.
